## Backlog
No backlog.

## Inheritance in Java
- Method overloading: Same name, but different signature
- protected/public attributes are methods are inherited and accessible.
- Constructor methods are *not* inherited. Use `super()` to call parent constructor.


Self-study Ex 8.3 and 8.4 p.345; See `A.java` and `B.java`

More inheritance:
See `InheritanceTest.java`, `Parent.java`, `Child.java`

## Three ways of polymorphism
1. Override method: See `Student.java` in l03
1. Implement abstract method: See `Animal.java` and `Dog.java`
1. Implement interface: See `Animal1.java` and `Dog1.java`, `Speakable.java`.
1. Implement interface: Another (better?) way, see See `Animal2.java` and `Dog2.java`

## Cipher
Section 8.5 Example: The Cipher Class Hierarchy

See `TestEncrypt.java`, `Cipher.java`, `Transpose.java` 

## Exercises
